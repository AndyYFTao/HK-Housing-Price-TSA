# Hong Kong Property Prices Time Series Analysis

Despite the recent hits to Hong Kong's economic growth, the city has continued to be the
most expensive housing market in the world. Applying various techniques from time series
analysis to its real residential property prices helps us understand the changes over years and
potentially forecast future prices. This project employs methods including Autoregressive in-
tegrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing and Facebook Prophet to analyze
the data across time.

Through various modeling processes, a better understanding of the real residential property
prices in Hong Kong is obtained: its overall trend, seasonality and outliers that are affected
by historical events and the law of supply & demand. The comparative advantages of different
models also become clear: the Box-Jenkins method being rigorous but lengthy, the exponential
smoothing being straightforward but prone to overfitting, the Facebook Prophet being flexible
but sophisticated. The analysis could be improved by better tuning model parameters, considering
alternative data processing techniques, or including more data points. More sophisticated
models such as LSTMs and RNNs in deep learning would also be valuable to explore.
